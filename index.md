# I hear you.

My name is Marie, and I would like to help.

I am from Rwanda, a place that went through genocide in 1994. The 2020 COVID-19 crisis reminds me so much of that tragedy. Thankfully  now we all have one common enemy.

I don't have any counseling certification, but I believe and trust from my own experience, I can listen to you and possibly advise you on how to manage your own worries, anxieties, and fears.

I currently live in the LA area but I can listen to anyone from anywhere.

If you'd like to talk, I am available at ‪(805) 285-3703‬.
