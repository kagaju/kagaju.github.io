          <h1>I hear you.</h1>

          <h6>My name is Marie, and I would like to help.</h6>

          <p>I am from Rwanda, a place that went through genocide in 1994. The 2020 COVID-19 crisis reminds me so much of that tragedy. Thankfully now we all have one common enemy.</p>

          <p>I don't have any counseling certification, but I believe and trust from my own experience, I can listen to you and possibly advise you on how to manage your own worries, anxieties, and fears.</p>

          <p>I currently live in the LA area but I can listen to anyone from anywhere.</p>

          <p>If you'd like to talk, I am available at ‪<a href="tel:(805) 285-3703‬">(805) 285-3703‬</a>. Stay strong and stay resilient. </p>
